I took this course on coursera.org, under the specialization: Full-Stack Web Development with React held by The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. Here is a link to the certificate:

This course deals with all things server-side. We base the entire course around the NodeJS platform. We start with a brief overview of the Web protocols: HTTP and HTTPS. We examine NodeJS and NodeJS modules: Express for building web servers. <br>
During this course I had to submit an assignment every week, for four weeks. At the end of this course, I was able to:<br>
-Demonstrate an understanding of server-side concepts, CRUD and REST<br>
-Build and configure a backend server using NodeJS framework<br>
-Build a RESTful API for the front-end to access backend services<br>
<br>
Week 1: Introduction to Server-side Development<br>
In this module I was introduced to Node, Node modules and the Node HTTP server. I learned about the Express framework and how to set up a REST API using Express.<br>
Assignment 1: At the end of this assignment, I have completed the following tasks:<br>
-Created a Node module using Express router to support the routes for the dishes REST API.<br>
-Created a Node module using Express router to support the routes for the promotions REST API.<br>
-Created a Node module using Express router to support the routes for the leaders REST API.<br>
<br>
Week 2: Data, Data, Where art Thou Data?<br>
This module looks in detail at data storage with MongoDB, the popular NoSQL database. I learned first about Express generator for scaffolding an Express application, 
then I learned about MongoDB, how to interact with MongoDB from a Node application and learned the Mongoose ODM to create schemas and models, and interact with MongoDB server.<br>
Assignment 2: At the end of this assignment, I have completed the following tasks:<br>
-Implemented the Promotions schema and model<br>
-Implement a REST API to support the /promotions endpoint, and the /promotions/:promoId endpoint enabling the interaction with the MongoDB database<br>
-Implemented the Leaders schema and model<br>
-Implement a REST API to support the /leaders endpoint, and the /leaders/:leaderId endpoint enabling the interaction with the MongoDB database<br>
<br>
Week 3: Halt! Who goes there?<br>
This module is dedicated to user authentication. We first developed a full-fledged REST API server with Express, Mongo and Mongoose. 
Thereafter we examineed basic authentication and session-based authentication briefly. 
We then developed token-based authentication with the support of JSON web tokens and the Passport module.<br>
Assignment 3: At the end of this assignment, I have completed the following tasks:<br>
-Check if a verified ordinary user also has Admin privileges.<br>
-Allow any one to perform GET operations<br>
-Allow only an Admin to perform POST, PUT and DELETE operations<br>
-Allow an Admin to be able to GET all the registered users' information from the database<br>
-Allow a registered user to submit comments (already completed), update a submitted comment and delete a submitted comment. 
The user should be restricted to perform such operations only on his/her own comments. No user or even the Admin can edit or delete the comments submitted by other users.<br>
<br>
Week 4: Backend as a Service (BaaS)<br>
In this module we learned about Mongoose population, a way of cross-referencing documents and populating the documents from other documents. 
We then reviewed secure communication using HTTPS, looked at Backend as a Service (BaaS) and took a brief look at Loopback.<br>
Assignment 4: At the end of this assignment, I have completed the following tasks:<br>
-Allowed users to select a dish as their favorite, and add it to the list of favorites that are saved on the server.<br>
-Allowed users to retrieve the list of their favorite dishes from the server<br>
-Delete one or all of their favorite dishes from their favorites list on the server.<br>
<br>
Thank you for your time!
